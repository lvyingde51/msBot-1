MsBot
=====
Simple bot used to get started with MS BotFramework. This is not meant for production use in anyway shape for form.

## How To Use
Start the [MsBot Emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com/) with the default settings and no credintials. Type `!card` followed by the name of a Grimiore Card, found in Destiny, and it will return the text of said card using the Ishtar Collectives API. As long as the card is spelt exactly like the name of the card. For example, to return the card text for say... Widows Court you need to enter - `!card ghost fragment widows court`.
